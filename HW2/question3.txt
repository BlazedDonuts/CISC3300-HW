Both flex box and CSS grid are ways to create the 
layout of a web page. Aspects such as spacing, alignment,
containing, filling, wrapping are possible thanks to both. 
The differences are also many: flexbox is one dimensional while CSS
grid is two-dimensional. So this menas that the best use for
flex-box would be nav bars or other small groups of items 
that can go in a single row or column. Css grid can help with more
complex web-page layouts/designs that involve both rows and columns.
