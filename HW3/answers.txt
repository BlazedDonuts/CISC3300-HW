1. It is a scripting language used alongside HTML and CSS 
used to make webpages interactive. It is an interpreted language
which means that the code is executed line by line, as opposed to
compiled language where the code is converted into machine code
before execution. 
2. Statistically typed languages enforce variable types at compile time whereas
dynamically tpyed laguages determine types at run time. Strongly tpyed languages
enforce strict type rules and prevent automatical type conversion
wheras weakly typed languages don't and allow them.
3. var is functin-scoped and allows re-declaration. Let is block scoped and does not
allow re-declaration. Const is block scoped and can't be re-assigned after intialization.
4. Anonymous functions have no name. Higher-order functions take other functions as 
arguments or return them. Callback functions are passed as arguments to functions. First-class
functions can be passed, returned, or assigned to other variables.
5. Objects in JS are like containers that hold different properties and methods, usually modeling
some sort of real life object.
