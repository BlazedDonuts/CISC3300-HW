1. DOM is an acryonym for the document object model which represents
the structure of a webpage. It helps developers access and
change elements using JS. The Dom tree is a representation of 
of a hierarchy of the document structure where each element is accessible 
and can be modified.

2. XSS attack, or cross site scripting, is a security vulnerability
which allows hackers to inject malicious scripts into webpages. These scripts,
once executed when the user is using them, can steal cookies or other personal 
information. Ways to stay safe include using proper headers, validating user inputs,
and encoding outputs.

3. An event is an action or something that triggers a series of instructions. For ex:
clickin a button is an event which triggers the behavior of clicking that specific
button. 

4. A DOM event listener is a function that waits for a specific event to occur on a DOM
element like a click. When the event occurs, the listener executes
a callback functin. The addEventListener metho contains 2 parameters. These include
the event type (clock, mouseover) and hte callback function, which is a function that runs
when the event occurs. It can also take more parameters.

5. JQuery is a JS library that simplifieshow you interact iwth HTML elements on a webpage
and perform tasks like animations. It is good to use because it makes coding more efficient and
simpler, saving time. JQuery allows you to write less code. To use JQuery, you need to include it
by adding a <script> tag in the HTML with source of the JQuery cdn link.
