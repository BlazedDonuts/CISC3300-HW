1. HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol and it is a networking protocol
that allows web browsers to communicate with web servers via data exchange. 
Everytime someone tries to load a webpage on a browser (ex: www.google.com), an HTTP
request is sent and a response is received. HTTP methods include: GET (which gets data
from a server), POST (which sends new data to the server to be saved), PUT (updates
existing data on the server), PATCH (partially updating), and DELETE (removing data
from the server). 

2. API stands for Application Programming Interface and it is a set of rules that allows
different software components to communicate with each other. APIs allow websites and applications
to share data without revealing their internal code. JSON stands for JavaScript Object
Notation, and is a format for sharing data between different systems. 

3. AJAX stands for asynchronous JavaAcript and XML, and it is a method used by web pages
to communicate with servers in the background without reloading pages (like updating scores
in games). Asynchronous means that the code doesn't block the running of all other 
code and waiting for something to finish. So when AJAX is running, the other code works just 
fine.


4. REST stands for representational state transfer and is a design style for creating APIs. 
Components are treated as "resources" like "post" or "users". Each resource is defined by a URI.
Resources are basically objects that can be accessed via RESTful APIs. 

5. Hoisting is the process where function declarations are moved to the top of their scope
before execution which allows for usage of a function before declaring it. A closure is 
what happens when a function remembers the variable from the outer scope even after the complete
execution of hte outer function.
