1. A class is a blueprint for creating objects and it defines specific
attributes and methods that every object will have. An object is an instance 
of a class with it's own set of specific attributes and behaviors (so a class 
can be cars, and an object of class cars can be "Honda: 2018, getSpeed()"). OOP 
stands for Object Oriented Programming, which uses objects and classes for 
efficiency and maintainability of programming. 

2. An abstract class is a base class which can't be instantiated on its own. 
It can include abstract methods which are declared and only implemented with subclasses.
Abstract classes help crate a template for other classes to follow and include 
many behaviors that can be shared among various subclasses. 

3. Superglobals are built in global arrays in PHP that can be accessed from 
any scope. Examples include $_Get which contains data sent to the script via the 
HTTP GET request and $_Post which contains data sent to the script 
via the HTTP POST.

4. First you need to declare a namespace (namespace app\models) and then you need to
use the namespace by including the "use" keyword (use app\models).

5. MVC stands for model view controller which is a way to organize your code 
in applications so that different parts of the application can work together without 
getting mixed up. It helps keep the interface and files separate and more manangable. 
The parts include the Model which is the data manager and handles all information 
that the app needs (like user info). Then the view which is the user interface and it shows 
the information from the model to the user in a presentable way. It also collects
inputs and sends it to the controller. The controller is the middleman between the model 
and the view -- it takes input and decides what to do with it.
