with a unique session Id. This Id is sent to the user's browser as a cookie which enables 
interactions like keeping users logged in even after exiting. Cookies are small
pieces of data stored on the client's browser which allows for faster retrieval of info everytime
client makes a request, stores preferences od user, and tracks site activity.
