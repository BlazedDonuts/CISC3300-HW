1. SQL is a language that is used to interact with databases that allows these 
tasks: create, read, update, delete. MySQL is a relational database management system 
that uses SQL to manage databases. Relationship databases are organized in tables with rows 
and columns where relationships are established using keys. 

2. Normalization is the method of organizing a database to reduce repetitiveness and 
dependency by dividing tables into smaller tables and creating relationships between 
them.

3. Primary keys are unique identifiers for each row in a table. Foreign keys are 
keys used in one table that originate from another table.

4. The three types of relationships are one to one (a single row in one table is linked to one row in 
another table), one to many (a single row in one table is linked to multiple rows in another table), and many 
to many (many rows in one table are linked to many rows in another table.)

5. Left join returns all the rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table. If 
there is no match, then null values are included for the right table. Inner join is when only 
rows where there is a match between tables is returned.
