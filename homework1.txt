    It has some of hte most important features such as the "login" and "About". When hovering over the different sections
    of the header, a drop down menu appears with more information. Then, there is the main page which usually showcases
    newsworthy fordham-related content and a link to access the article. The page continues down with different sections, such as more information
    about the campus, a video, an events section, university news, and finally the footer. Sectioning it off in this way helps the user
    navigate the page easily.
